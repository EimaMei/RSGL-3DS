# RSGL 3DS
![alt text](https://github.com/RSGL-Org/RSGL-3DS/blob/main/logo.png?raw=true)

This is the official port of RSGL for the 3DS, done by EimaMei</br >
RSGL Discord server for support: https://discord.gg/ckC7mqdjCb
# Notes
1. The library port is not finished yet, and the port will get constant updates to keep up with the main RSGL repository.<br />
2. This isn't a replacement of devkitpro's libraries, this is just used to port RSGL programs to 3DS or begin developing with RSGL for 3DS first since it's a bit easier to learn and use.<br />
3. If you're getting errors/something isn't right, then you should look at the wiki as it might've been already covered there. If that error wasn't documented, then raise an issue (Note: make sure the error isn't like a syntax error from your source file, as it's your fault, and not ours) 
# Requirements for the development
1. Citra/hacked Nintendo 3DS with homebrew (You can use both if you want)
2. DevkitPro with 3DS Development enabled<br />
# Plans
1. Add the main-library features<br />
2. Make a documentation and/or wiki for the port<br />
3. Create exclusive 3DS features (like 3D Mode)<br />
