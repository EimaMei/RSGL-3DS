# RSGL 3DS
This is the official port of RSGL for the 3DS, done by EimaMei</br >
RSGL Discord server for support: https://discord.gg/ckC7mqdjCb
# Notes
1. The library port is not finished yet, and the port will get constant updates to keep up with the main RSGL repository.<br />
2. This isn't a replacement of devkitpro's libraries, this is just used to port RSGL programs to 3DS or begin developing with RSGL for 3DS first since it's a bit easier to learn and use.<br />
# Requirements for the development
1. A hacked 3DS (can be old or new)<br />
2. Homebrew<br />
3. DevkitPro with 3DS Development enabled<br />
# Plans
1. Add the main-library features<br />
2. Make a documentation and/or wiki for the port<br />
3. Create exclusive 3DS features (like 3D Mode)<br />
